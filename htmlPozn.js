ATTRibutes
All HTML elements can have ATTRIBUTES
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>

The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:
<img src="img_girl.jpg">

The width and height Attributes
<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">

The alt Attribute
The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, 
if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">

The style Attribute
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

The title Attribute
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:
<p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>

We Suggest: Always Use Lowercase Attributes!!!!

Single or Double Quotes?
Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.
In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:
<p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>
Or vice versa:
<p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">
